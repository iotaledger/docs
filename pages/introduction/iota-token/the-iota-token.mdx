The IOTA token is a \`cryptotoken\` built upon the Tangle technology. The
token benefits from the advantages of this new Tangle architecture.
The IOTA token is a `crypto-token` built for the Tangle technology.  Using
this token humans or machines can send transactions through the Tangle to
purchase goods or services.  For example, in the Netherlands there is an
“IOTA” smart charging station for electric cars.  Drive up, plug in, and
charge your car with IOTA tokens!

That’s one good example.  There are more.  Consider the Internet of Things (IoT)
and future machine-2-machine (M2M) transactions.  Suppose Siri, your virtual
assistant, reads your calendar and sees you have a meeting across town at 2pm.
She checks your IOTA account then schedules a taxi.  The taxi picks you up
and drops you off while getting paid with IOTA tokens.  With no transport
worries, you have more time to prepare for your meeting! 

Thinking green, suppose you are an international organization tasked with 
making sure people living in a remote area have fresh water.  The IOTA Tangle
plus API and visualization tools ensure full transparency for all your 
transactions with no lost tokens.  Additionally, IOTA also runs on small
devices using battery power so you can send transactions in remote areas.

To get started, you need IOTA tokens.  The **DevNet** faucet drips test tokens
for use on the DevNet Tangle.  These tokens have no value in the real world.
They are used for building apps and running experiments on the Tangle.

IOTA tokens have monetary value.  You can purchase them at a cryptocurrency
exchange.  IOTA tokens operate on a permission-less Tangle 
network known as the **Mainnet**.    Individuals are able to interact with this
network by operating a full node that is peered with neighbours. 
Alternatively they can interact with public Mainnet nodes operated by a third party.


## Token Generation

IOTA token generation is a new paradigm.  All the IOTA token's that will 
ever exist were created with the genesis transaction. This means that the 
total supply of IOTA's will always stay the same and you cannot "mine" IOTA's.  
Therefore, keep in mind, if you do Proof of Work in IOTA, you are not 
generating new IOTA tokens, you're simply verifying other transactions.

## Token Supply

The total supply of IOTA is `(3^33-1) / 2`, which equals to a total number
of IOTA's of `2779530283277761`. IOTA is specifically designed for machines,
so this high supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny **nano-transactions** while still
keeping efficiency in mind.

This supply fits nicely into the `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` value in Javascript.

## Supply Etomology

Since the number of tokens is quite high we adhere to the SI notation to write
in short hand to denote a large number of tokens. Here is a breakdown of the notation:

## A Note in Trinary

In this documentation you will often hear the phrase trinary-based which
is a reference to the unique data structure being utilized in IOTA.
Whenever we refer to trinary-based seeds, addresses, hashes etc., it means
that the string can only consist of characters in the latin alphabet and 9.

<Code>{`// All possible tryte values var trytesAlphabet = "9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`}</Code>

Valid Trytes: `VBVEUQY`

Invalid Trytes: `Vaafd8432`

Because of the way that Kerl works, a single hash consists of 81-trytes (81 characters)
- sometimes it can be written using 90-trytes (81 –trytes plus a 9-tryte checksum).
