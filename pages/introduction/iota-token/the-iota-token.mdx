The IOTA token is a \`cryptotoken\` built upon the Tangle technology. The
token benifits from the advantages of this new Tangle architecture.

The token operates on a permission-less Tangle network known as the **Mainnet**.
Individuals are able to interact with this network by operating
a full node that is peered with neighbours. Alternatively they are able to
public Mainnet nodes operated by a third party.

## Token Generation

All IOTA's which will ever exist have been created with the genesis
transaction. This means that the total supply of IOTA's will always
stay the same and you cannot "mine" IOTA's. Therefore keep in mind,
if you do Proof of Work in IOTA you are not generating new IOTA
tokens, you're simply verifying other transactions.

## Token Supply

The total supply of IOTA is `(3^33-1) / 2`, which equals to a total number
of IOTA's of `2779530283277761`. IOTA is specifically designed for machines,
so this high supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny **nano-transactions** while still
keeping efficiency in mind.

This supply fits nicely into the `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` value in Javascript.

## Supply Etomology

Since the number of tokens is quite high we adhere to the SI notation to write
in short hand to denote a large number of tokens. Here is a breakdown of the notation:

    <Cell>Amount</Cell>
    <TypeCell>Powers</TypeCell>

    <Cell>Kilo IOTA</Cell>
    <Cell>1.000</Cell>

  </Row>
</Table>

## A Note in Trinary

In this documentation you will often hear the phrase trinary-based which
is a reference to the unique data structure being utilized in IOTA.
Whenever we refer to trinary-based seeds, addresses, hashes etc., it means
that the string can only consist of characters in the latin alphabet and 9.

<Code>{`// All possible tryte values var trytesAlphabet = "9ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`}</Code>
Because of the way that Kerl works, a single hash always consists of 81-trytes (81 characters) - sometimes it can be 90-trytes (including 9-tryte checksum).

Valid Trytes: `VBVEUQY`

Invalid Trytes: `Vaafd8432`
