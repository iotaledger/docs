IOTA uses PoW for spam protection, similar in spirit to the
PoW used in [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash).
This is a short computational operation,
which should not be confused with the expensive PoW employed in
miner-based ledgers such as Bitcoin.

## Min Weight Magnitude

The difficulty of the PoW is set by a variable called Minimum Weight
Magnitude (MWM). This refers to the number of trailing zeros (in trits)
in transaction hash. MWM is proportional to the difficulty of the Proof of Work.

The device which does the PoW will bruteforce the transaction
hash to find a \`nonce\` that has the correct number of trailing 0's.
Every extra trailing zero to be found will increase the difficulty of PoW
by 3 times.

### MWM values

- Mainnet MWM parameter: 14
- Devnet  MWM parameter: 9
- Spamnet MWM parameter: 7
