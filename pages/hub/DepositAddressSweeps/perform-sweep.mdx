** What are sweeps? **

Sweeps are transfers from user deposit addresses to cold storage or hot wallet using the process shown below.

** Why are sweeps important? **

The exchange only secures funds in unspent addresses.  Otherwise, it is the user’s responsibility to secure their funds.  
 
Sweeps are crucial to securely crediting users after moving funds from their deposit addresses.  Suppose, a user deposits to an already swept address, an adversary might try to forge a signature and move the funds out of this address. Therefore, funds should be swept to your hot wallet or cold storage periodically.

** When should I credit users? **

Crediting should only be performed after confirming sweep transactions to make sure funds are in your possession.
 
You should absolutely inform the user of the risk of total loss should he send to a deposit address provided by the exchange more than once.
