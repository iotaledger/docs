### IOTA & Exchanges

Exchanges manage tasks associated with deposits and withdrawals of Iota.  For security purposes, Iota deposit addresses may only be used once.  Exchanges conduct “sweeps” periodically to transfer funds from a user deposit address to a hot wallet or cold storage for safekeeping.  Exchanges also monitor confirmations and re-attachments.  In order to accomplish these tasks, we recommend using the IOTA Hub.  In addition to IOTA Hub, we provide tools based on the IOTA JavaScript API (iota-lib-js).

### IOTA Hub

IOTA Hub is not an IOTA node.  It is a tool for managing transfers from/to addresses in a simple and secure manner.  Additionally, IOTA Hub offers a mechanism to recover funds in case a user sent tokens to a deposit address that has been swept.  This might occur when a user sends tokens to a deposit address more than once since deposit addresses are not reusable.

The remaining sections of this document explain the details of key exchange processes and offer additional tools.
