When receiving a user deposit, the exchange can generate a a secure seed for the user.  Seeds must be securely generated and stored because a seed is used to derive a private key.  Private keys are used to sign transactions.
 
Seeds in IOTA consist of 81 trytes ('9,A-Z'), which is equivalent to 384 bits security. 

	27 valid characters with 81 picked at random:  \log_2(27^{81}) \ is approx 384

 
Most programming languages have a cryptographically secure PRNG generally based on /dev/urandom.  Here are two examples for generating seeds using  random number generators::
 
### Linux Shell
	 
	cat /dev/urandom |tr -dc A-Z9|head -c${1:-81}

### Mac
	cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1
 
	
	Note:  these examples are shown for educational purposes only

 
For completeness, when discussing random number generators, one must consider entropy.  Entropy is the “randomness” collected when generating a random number.  Different operating systems accomplish this differently.  One popular method is using mouse movements to collect entropy.    
 
We leave it up to exchanges to securely generate and store their seeds.
