Once a secure seed has been generated, deposit addresses can be created.  Like the seed, an address is 81-trytes long. One easy way to generate an address is to use getNewAddress()



    const iota = new IOTA({provider: "https://nodes.testnet.iota.org:443"})
    const remoteCurl = require('@iota/curl-remote')
     
    seed = 'SEEDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS'
     
    iota.api.getNewAddress(seed, {index: 0 , total: 1, security: 2, checksum: false}, function(e, address)
    {
            console.log(address)
    })

 

**NOTICE**

When generating addresses, keep track of the index.  Start with index = 0 and increment by one.
 
Using this example, you may generate a total of 1 or more addresses.  When generating more than one address, the index will automatically increment by one.
 
Set security level to 1, 2, or 3.  Setting checksum to true will add the 9-tryte checksum to the end. 
 

**WARNING**

Double check whether the API call requires the 81-tryte address or the 90-tryte address plus checksum.  Most often only 81 trytes are needed and checksum should be false.
