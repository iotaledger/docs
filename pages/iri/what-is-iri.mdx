The IOTA Reference Implementation, commonly known as IRI, is
the standard or model for an IOTA Node.

The IRI software enables individuals to operate a Node for
processing and recording transactions on the Tangle.

## The Node

Running the IRI software enables your device to communicate
with neighbours in the peer-to-peer network that the Tangle operates.

The official IRI Github repository can be found
here: <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iri" key="">https://github.com/iotaledger/iri</ExternalLink>

## Why run a Node? 

It encourages decentralization of the network, and removes the need to trust a third party node to access the Tangle.
