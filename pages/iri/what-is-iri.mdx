The IOTA Reference implementation, commonly known as IRI, is
the reference implimentation of the IOTA 'node' software in Java.

The IRI software enables the Tangle to operate by enabling individuals
to run the software and operate a Node.

## The Node

Running the IRI software enables your device to communicate
with neighbours in the peer-to-peer network that the Tangle operates
on. Any device connected to the network.

The official IRI Github repository can be found
here: <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iri" key="">https://github.com/iotaledger/iri</ExternalLink>

## Why run a Node? 

It encourages decentralization of the network, and removes the need to trust a third party node to access the Tangle.
Access to a running node is required to access the Tangle.
